# Monster Cat Replica  

This is a practice project that replicates the design and functionality of the Monster Cat website. The project consists of a frontend that displays content dynamically and a backend server that provides the necessary data.  

## Project Description  

This project is a learning exercise to improve web development skills, including:  

- Creating a structured frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Fetching and displaying data dynamically from a Node.js backend.  
- Setting up a simple local API to serve data to the frontend.  

The goal is to understand how a frontend communicates with a backend and how to structure a project efficiently.  

## Features  

- A visually accurate replica of the Monster Cat website.  
- A Node.js backend that serves data to the frontend.  
- Dynamic content fetching using JavaScript.
